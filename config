[input]

# Audio capturing method. Possible methods are: 'fifo', 'portaudio', 'pipewire', 'alsa', 'pulse', 'sndio', 'oss', 'jack' or 'shmem'
# Defaults to 'oss', 'pipewire', 'sndio', 'jack', 'pulse', 'alsa', 'portaudio' or 'fifo', in that order, dependent on what support cava was built with.
# On Mac it defaults to 'portaudio' or 'fifo'
# On windows this is automatic and no input settings are needed.
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source'
# to define where it should get the audio.
#
# For pulseaudio and pipewire 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the monitor source of the default sink
# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them).
#
# For pipewire 'source' will be the object name or object.serial of the device to capture from.
# Both input and output devices are supported. To capture the monitor source of a sink node, append '.monitor' to the sink's object name.
#
# For alsa 'source' will be the capture device.
# For fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file.
# For shmem 'source' will be /squeezelite-AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF where 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF' will be squeezelite's MAC address
#
# For sndio 'source' will be a raw recording audio descriptor or a monitoring sub-device, e.g. 'rsnd/2' or 'snd/1'. Default: 'default'.
# README.md contains further information on how to setup CAVA for sndio.
#
# For oss 'source' will be the path to a audio device, e.g. '/dev/dsp2'. Default: '/dev/dsp', i.e. the default audio device.
# README.md contains further information on how to setup CAVA for OSS on FreeBSD.
#
# For jack 'source' will be the name of the JACK server to connect to, e.g. 'foobar'. Default: 'default'.
# README.md contains further information on how to setup CAVA for JACK.

# The options 'sample_rate', 'sample_bits', 'channels' and 'autoconnect' can be configured for some input methods:
#   sample_rate: fifo, pipewire, sndio, oss
#   sample_bits: fifo, pipewire, sndio, oss
#   channels:    sndio, oss, jack
#   autoconnect: jack
# Other methods ignore these settings.
# For pipewire, sample_rate will default to 48000, for all other input methods, sample_rate will default to 44100.
#
# For 'sndio' and 'oss' they are only preferred values, i.e. if the values are not supported
# by the chosen audio device, the device will use other supported values instead.
# Example: 48000, 32 and 2, but the device only supports 44100, 16 and 1, then it
# will use 44100, 16 and 1.
#
#
# The 'pipewire' input method has three options to control linking and mixing:
#   active: Force the node to always process. Useful for monitoring sources when no other application is active.
#   remix: Allow pipewire to remix audio channels to match cava's channel count. Useful for surround sound.
#   virtual: Set the node to virtual, to avoid recording notifications from the DE.
